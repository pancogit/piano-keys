Put this folder in location where some web server is installed.
For example, if Nginx web server is installed on macOS
using homebrew formula installation, then copy this folder
to "piano-keys" folder:

for homebrew nginx folder:
/opt/homebrew/opt/nginx/html/piano-keys
or
$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/nginx/html/piano-keys

for homebrew general web server www folder:
/opt/homebrew/var/www/piano-keys
or
$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/var/www/piano-keys

Then open web browser with url address:
http://localhost:8080/piano-keys/

Otherwise, copy this folder to folder where another web server
is installed and repeat the same procedure.

Notes for code formatting:

If prettier js is used for code formatting in Visual Studio Code,
then it will not be applied properly for tab indentations and other
prettier configurations because configuration file is not detected
outside of home folder. This folder should be copied to the local
web server and that path is not inside home directory and in that
way, prettier will not see configuration file. Prettier configuration
file can be set from Visual Studio Code Settings directly, but it will
still not work. To make it work on web server, then open default 
configuration file inside homebrew installation folder for macOS:

/opt/homebrew/.editorconfig

and change line
indent_size = 2

to
indent_size = 4.

Then prettier configuration file will not be loaded, but default
configuration file for code formatter will be used instead.
